Object Recognition through Smartphone Using Transfer Learning(Modified)

Click2KnowM is about achieving the goal of object recognition through advanced techniques like deep learning on handy devices like smartphones and tablets. Deep learning algorithms (Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)) are used for the primary aim of object recognition. 

Images are clicked through the camera of the smartphone during experimentation and are fed to the CNN network. The top four results predicted by the network are depicted on the smartphone screen in the audio and the visual form i.e. predicted object name and the probability of predicted object being the one actually clicked in the decreasing order of probabilities. The accuracy obtained in object recognition is about 93% through the application.
